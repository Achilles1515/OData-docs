## Changes in ODataLib 7.1.1 Release ##

## Notes ##

7.1.1 is a re-release of 7.1.0 without the NetStandard version of ODataLib, EdmLib and Spatial due to an issue found in the NetStandard versions of those binaries. The PCL versions of those binaries are unaffected.

This release delivers OData core libraries including ODataLib, EdmLib and Spatial. OData Client for .NET is not published in this release.
