# Welcome to OData

OData (Open Data Protocol) is an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming REST APIs.
OData enables creation of REST-based services which allow resources identified using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and defined in a data model, to be published and edited by Web clients using simple HTTP messages.

OData helps applications to focus on business logic without worrying about the various API approaches to define request and response headers, status codes, HTTP methods, URL conventions, media types, payload formats, query options, etc.
It provides guidance for tracking changes, defining functions/actions for reusable procedures, and sending asynchronous/batch requests.

OData improves semantic interoperability between systems and follows these design principles:

- Follow REST principles.
- Keep it simple. Address the common cases and provide extensibility where necessary.
- Build incrementally. A very basic, compliant service should be easy to build, with additional work necessary only to support additional capabilities.
- Extensibility is important. Services should be able to support extended functionality without breaking clients unaware of those extensions.
